# Portfolio Project - React+Redux - Summer Reading

## Description

This portfolio project is for website for a summer reading program. The application allows users to view a list of existing books from the database and add any number of them into their reading list. Users are able to view details about each book. Users can use a web form to add new books to the database of books, and then add those to their reading list too. Users can also remove books from their reading list and remove books from the database entirely. Finally, the reading list displays some basic statistics about the userâ€™s list.

Additional features include the incorporation of the [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) front-end CSS library.
